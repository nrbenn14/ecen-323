I am from Portland, Oregon and have lived there since I was six. 
I enjoy listening to music, cooking, and snowboarding. 
This weekend I am going up to Logan to spend time with my girlfriend and her family. Should be fun!
My favorite type of food is sandwiches, honestly. Very customizable and versatile.
