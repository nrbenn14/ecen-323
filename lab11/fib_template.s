    # Setup the stack: sp = 0x3ffc
    lui sp, 4				# 4 << 12 = 0x4000
    addi sp, sp, -4			# 0x4000 - 4 = 0x3ffc

    # Load the loop terminal count value (in the .data segment)

    # The following assembly language macro is useful for accessing variables
    # in the data segment. This macro helps determine the address of data variables.
    # The form of the macro is '%lo(label)(register). The 'label' refers to
    # a label in the data segment and the register refers to the RISC-V base
    # register used to access the memory. In this case, the label is 
    # 'fib_count' (see the .data segment) and the register is 'gp' which points
    # to the data segment. The assembler will figure out what the offset is for
    # 'fib_count' from the data segment.
